1) Corrected outfile when using
    Fridu-firewall  start  dump=/tmp/outputfile
    Now /tmp/outputfile can be ex√©cuted with "sh -x /tmp/outputfile" for debug purpose

25-dec-2008: Thank to "Murat, Netherland" review

1) Removed useless ICMP rules from OUTPUT chain.
2) Added LOG and ICMP special rules in fw-rules/sample-log

05-dec-2008: 

1) Change default beaviour now Default is set by FWCONFIG in:
   /etc/default/Fridu-default   (debian, ubuntu)
   /etc/sysconfig/Fridu-default (OpenSUSE, RedHat, ...)

2) When starting firewall with no default template, or with a wrong one
   exist before setting any filtering rules (old version will close
   everything). Preventing you to even fix the error by SSH (hoop !!!)
