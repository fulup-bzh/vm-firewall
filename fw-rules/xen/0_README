#  This sample is designed for test only, and simulate Internet
#  on your local network. It does not integrated VPN
#  and admin is done true basic ssh dnat port dnating.
#  Each VM can obvisouly accessing Internet. For Admin:
#     ssh -p  22 root@dom0  (connect dom0)
#     ssh -p  23 root@dom0  (connect Xen-ZA-One)
#     ssh -p  24 root@dom0  (connect Xen-ZA-Two)
#     ssh -p 222 root@dom0 (connect Xen-ZB-one) 
#
# Exercise: (few things you should test, before moving to next level)
#   1) connect on XEN-one through SSH from 10.10.10.6
#   2) open FTP on DOM0 and make it accessible from every VM but not from Internet
#   3) make outgoing packet from zone one to appear as comming from 10.10.11.5
#      while packet from zone2 appear as 10.10.11.6
#   4) prevent/allow both zones to talk together 
#   etc ....

# Note: This model is the one you MUST use is you have one than
# one external IP address. For real production you probably want
# a VPN (see vpn sample)
